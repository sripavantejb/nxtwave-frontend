,,,,Which of the following numbers is divisible by 7?,Medium,1112,1342,1435,1263,Option C,"Divisibility rule of 7:

Take the last digit of the number. Double it.
Subtract this doubled value from the remaining part of the number (the number without its last digit).
If the result is 0 or divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.
If it’s still large, repeat the process.

Let's apply this rule to the given numbers,  
Option-A: 1112  
Last digit: 2  
Remaining part: 111  
2 × 2 = 4  
111 - 4 = 107  
107 is not divisible by 7, so 1112 is not divisible by 7.  
  
Option-B: 1342  
Last digit: 2  
Remaining part: 134  
2 × 2 = 4  
134 - 4 = 130  
130 is not divisible by 7, so 1342 is not divisible by 7.  
  
Option-C: 1435  
Last digit: 5  
Remaining part: 143  
2 × 5 = 10  
143 - 10 = 133  
133 is divisible by 7, so 1435 is divisible by 7.  
  
Option-D: 1263  
Last digit: 3  
Remaining part: 126  
2 × 3 = 6  
126 - 6 = 120  
120 is not divisible by 7, so 1263 is not divisible by 7.  
Therefore, out of the given numbers, 1435 is the one that is divisible by 7."

$i^3$ = -i 
$i^4$ = 1

After every four powers of i, the pattern repeats. So,

$i^{64} = i^{4 \times 16}$ = $(i^4)^{16} = 1^{16}$ = 1

Therefore, $i^{64} = 1$."
,,,,What is the value of ${i}^{48}$ + 1 ?,Medium,0,2,1,-1,Option B,"To find ${i}^{48}$  
Where i is the imaginary unit:  
We know that,  
  
$i^0 =1, i^1 = \sqrt{(-1)}$, ${i}^{2}$ = -1, ${i}^{3}$ = -i, ${i}^{4}$ = 1  
  
And the cycle repeats for every 4 powers:  
So, the powers of i form a mod 4 cycle.  
Now, divide the exponent by 4:  
  
48 ÷ 4 = 12 remainder 0  
  
So, ${i}^{48}$ = ${i}^{0}$ = 1  
${i}^{48}$ + 1  
= 1 + 1 = 2  
  
Hence, ${i}^{48}$ + 1 = 2"
,,,,"If $(-1)^{n} +(-1)^{4n}$ = 0, then n is ?",Hard,Any positive integer,Any odd natural number,Any negative integer,Any even natural number,Option B,"To find the value of ""n"" when $(-1)^{n} +(-1)^{4n}$ = 0, you can break it down and simplify it,  
$(-1)^{n}$ represents a sequence of alternating signs: 1, -1, 1, -1, ...  
$(-1)^{4n}$ represents a sequence where the exponent is always even, so its result is 1.
 
Now, you have the equation:  
$(-1)^{n}$ + 1 = 0  
$(-1)^{n}$ = -1
  
Now, if you think about the alternating sign pattern of $(-1)^{n}$, you'll notice that it becomes -1 when ""n"" is an odd positive integer, and it becomes 1 when ""n"" is an even positive integer.
  
So, for $(-1)^{n}$ to equal -1, ""n"" must be an odd positive integer.  
In summary, ""n"" is any odd natural number."

,,,,Find the units digit of $(11!)^{789}$,Medium,1,2,0,3,Option C,"To find the units digit of $(11!)^{789}$ 
We need to take the factorial of 11, raise it to the 789th power, and find the last digit (units digit) of that huge number.

Now,  
$11! = 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1$

That means $11!$ includes both 2 and 5 as factors.  
For example:  
5 and 10 → contribute factors of 5  
2, 4, 6, 8, 10 → contribute factors of 2

So, $11!$ definitely contains at least one factor of 10, and hence ends with 0.

Now, unit place of $(11!)^{789}$ means $0^{789}$

$0^{789} = 0$

Hence, the units digit of $(11!)^{789}$ is 0."

,,,,What is the last digit of $1234^{5678}$?,Hard,2,3,6,8,Option C,"To find the units digit (i.e., the last digit) of $1234^{5678}$  
We need to find the last digit of a huge number generated by raising 1234 to the 5678th power.

Now, we should consider the last digit of the base,   
Last digit of 1234 is 4

So, we are essentially finding the units digit of $4^{5678}$

Let’s observe the pattern of unit digits in powers of 4:

$4^1$ = 4 (last digit = 4)  
$4^2$ = 16 (last digit = 6)  
$4^3$ = 64 (last digit = 4)  
$4^4$ = 256 (last digit = 6)

So, the cycle of 4 is: (4, 6) — length = 2

Now, divide the exponent 5678 by the cycle length:

,,,,Determine the rightmost non zero digit of $650^{876}$.,Hard,2,3,7,5,Option D,"To find the rightmost non-zero digit of $650^{876}$.  
This is not the same as the units digit, because $650^{876}$ ends with several zeros due to factors of 10.  
We want the digit just before those trailing zeros.  
First, write 650 as a product of prime factors:  
  
$650 = 2 \times 5^2 \times 13$  
  
So, $650^{876} = (2 \times 5^2 \times 13)^{876} = 2^{876} \times 5^{1752} \times 13^{876}$  
  
Each pair of $2 \times 5$ contributes a factor of 10, which gives a trailing zero.  
The number of such pairs is $\min(876, 1752) = 876$  
  
That means $650^{876}$ ends in 876 zeros.  
  
To find the rightmost non-zero digit, we remove those zeros and focus on:  
  
$\dfrac{650^{876}}{10^{876}} = \dfrac{2^{876} \times 5^{1752} \times 13^{876}}{10^{876}} = \dfrac{(2 \times 5)^{876} \times 5^{876} \times 13^{876}}{10^{876}} = 5^{876} \times 13^{876}$  
  
Now we find the units digit of $13^{876}$.  
  
Observe the pattern of last digits of powers of 13:  
  
$13^1 = 13$ → last digit is 3  
$13^2 = 169$ → last digit is 9  
$13^3 = 2197$ → last digit is 7  
$13^4 = 28561$ → last digit is 1  
  
So the cycle is (3, 9, 7, 1), repeating every 4 powers.  
  
Now divide $876 \div 4 = 219$ remainder 0  
  
So, $13^{876}$ ends with the same digit as $13^4$, which is 1.  
  
Now multiply with $5^{876}$.  
  
$5^1 = 5$  
$5^2 = 25$  
$5^3 = 125$  
  
All powers of 5 (ignoring zeros) end in 5.  
  
So the last non-zero digit of $5^{876} \times 13^{876}$ is the same as that of $5 \times 1 = 5$  
  
Hence, the rightmost non-zero digit of $650^{876}$ is 5."

$4^5$ = 4  
  
So the cycle is 4, 1 and it repeats every 2 terms.  
  
Now divide the exponent 5 by the cycle length 2:

Let the number be N.  
So,  
N = 35k + 5 for some integer k.

To find the remainder when N is divided by 28.

Now divide N by 28:

N ÷ 28 = (35k + 5) ÷ 28

Note that 35 ≡ 7 when divided by 28 (because 35 ÷ 28 leaves a remainder 7)
So:  
(35k + 5) ÷ 28 becomes  
(7k + 5) ÷ 28

We want to find the smallest value of N, so take k = 0 first:
Then N = 35(0) + 5 = 5  
5 ÷ 28 = remainder 5

Try k = 1 → N = 35(1) + 5 = 40 → 40 ÷ 28 = remainder 12  
k = 2 → N = 75 → remainder 19  
k = 3 → 110 → remainder 26

,Percentages 2,Do you know how to find the overall percentage change after successive % changes?,"If a value changes by $x\%$ and then by $y\%$ (increase or decrease), 
the net $\%$ change is:

$\text{Net \% change} = x + y + \dfrac{x \times y}{100}$

If it’s a decrease, take the percentage as negative.
Positive result → net increase
Negative result → net decrease",A shopkeeper increases the price of an item by 10% and then increases another 20% on the new price. What is the net change in price?,Easy,30  %,32  %,33 %,34 %,Option B,"$\text{Net \% change} = x + y + \dfrac{x \times y}{100}$

Here, $x\%=10$, $y\%=20$ then,

Net change = $10 + 20 + \dfrac{10 \times 20}{100} = 32\%$"
